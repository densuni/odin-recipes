      <h2>Description</h2>
        
      <p>On first glance these homemade cinnamon rolls may not look like anything out of the ordinary. Buttery, golden brown yeasted dough, check; delicious cinnamon–brown sugar filling, check; decadent cream cheese icing, check. But we’re putting it all on the line to wager that this recipe, thanks to a few choice tactical twists, produces the best, most ooey-gooey, perfectly fluffy from-scratch buns you’ll ever make.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h4>Dough</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2¼ cups whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>5¾ cups (719 g) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼-oz envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp Morton kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Filling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tbsp heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ tsp Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp Morton kosher salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Frosting and Assembly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pans</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour (for surface)</li>
        <li>8 oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1¼ cups (138 g or more) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (or more) heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon zest (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>

      <h4>Dough</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk ¾ cup whole milk and ¼ cup (31 g) all-purpose flour in a medium saucepan until smooth. Place saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thickened and whisk lines are visible on bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Scrape tangzhong into the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool.</li>
        <li>Add 1 large egg, one ¼-oz envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp), ⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar, 1 tbsp Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp Morton kosher salt,  and remaining 1½ cups whole milk to tangzhong and whisk to combine. Add remaining 5½ cups (688 g) all-purpose flour. Fit bowl onto stand mixer; fit mixer with dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and mix, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, until dough is smooth and elastic, 18–24 minutes. Pinch off a golf-ball-size piece of dough and stretch between your fingers as thin as possible without breaking. If you can see light through the dough, it’s ready. If not, continue mixing a few more minutes, then try again.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces, to dough and mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Continue mixing until dough pulls away cleanly from sides of bowl and is no longer tacky to the touch, 5–7 minutes longer. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let sit in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 60–90 minutes.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Filling</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>While the dough is rising, cook ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter foams and milk solids turn dark amber, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool slightly. Add 1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar, 2 tbsp ground cinnamon, 2 tbsp heavy cream, and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp Morton kosher salt to butter and mix to combine.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Frosting and Assembly</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Butter two 9"-diameter cake pans. Punch down dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Stretch dough into a rough rectangle; if dough feels stiff, let sit 5–10 minutes to allow gluten to relax. Arrange dough with short side facing you and roll out to a 24x13" rectangle. Spread filling over dough in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Starting at edge closest to you, tightly roll up dough into a log; roll log seam side down. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim ends of log; discard. Using serrated knife or, preferably, unflavored dental floss, cut log in half crosswise, then cut each half into 6 equal rounds. (If using dental floss, slide floss underneath dough, then cross over top and pull ends through.) Nestle 6 rounds, cut side down, in each prepared cake pan. Cover with damp kitchen towels and let sit in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 30–50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Bake rolls until golden on top and puffed (don’t be alarmed if they rise dramatically in the center), 25–30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium speed or a whisk, beat 4 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature, and 8 oz cream cheese, room temperature, in a large bowl, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until combined. Add 1¼ cups (138 g) powdered sugar, 1 tbsp heavy cream, 1 tsp lemon zest (if using), and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt and beat until mixture is smooth and sugar is incorporated. Taste and beat in more powdered sugar (up to ¾ cup) if desired. Thin with more cream as needed, a teaspoonful at a time, until frosting is thick but spreadable.</li>
        <li>Let cinnamon rolls cool in pan 5 minutes; spread frosting over.</li>
      </ol>
