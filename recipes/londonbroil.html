      <h2>Description</h2>
        
      <p>In the mood for steak but don’t feel like shelling out the big bucks for a rib eye or New York strip? This London broil recipe is your answer.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h4>London Broil Marinade</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp good-quality balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1½–2 lb London broil</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Assembly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>

      <h4>London Broil Marinade</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk together 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tbsp good-quality balsamic vinegar, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce in a medium bowl or baking dish; season with freshly ground black pepper. Whisk in ¾ tsp baking soda (don’t worry if marinade fizzes; that’s the baking soda working).</li>
        <li>Prick one 1½–2 lb London broil all over with a fork and add to marinade; turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour or cover and chill up to 12 hours.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Assembly</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip back into bowl, and pat dry with paper towels; reserve marinade. Season steak generously with kosher salt and cook, turning once, until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 125° for medium-rare, 8–12 minutes. Using tongs, stand steak on its sides and cook until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, transfer reserved marinade to a small saucepan, add ⅓ cup water, and bring to a boil (mixture will foam up). Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to avoid overflow, until foaming subsides, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tbsp unsalted butter and whisk vigorously to emulsify sauce. Keep warm until ready to serve. </li>
        <li>Thinly slice steak against the grain and arrange on a platter. Spoon sauce over; sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</li>
      </ol>
